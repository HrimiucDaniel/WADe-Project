        <h2>Abstract - The requirements of the project</h2>

        <p>Develop a service-oriented system offering features regarding botanical gardens' cartography, including the digital ways to explore and display educational information about species of plants. Additionally, the application will be able to manage different dataflows/workflows concerning guided tours, plant/art exhibitions (e.g., the annual Chrysanthemums autumnal exhibition), taxonomic-oriented studies (i.e. learning about plant classification), specific activities (plant conservation, soil preparation, seeding procedures, pollution prevention, etc.) and others. For each item (thing), the user could specify useful information like comments, images, relations with other near-by objects – for example, "Rosa bunda" variety of roses is placed in the centre of the rosarium section of the Botanical Gardens of Iasi. Available knowledge will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint, in conjunction to other sources of interest such as DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Bonus: adopting (multilingual) conversational user interactions.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the web application is to provide an integrated environment where users can find out information about the areas, the plants of a botanical garden, can make reservations for the exhibitions organized by the botanical garden and can also contribute to the community with their own comments and images related to different plants.</p>

        <h2>Guided Tour Service</h2>
        <p>Our objective is to develop a service facilitating user navigation within specific zones of the Botanical Garden of Iasi. To accomplish this, we have devised a service that calculates an optimized route through the user-selected zones.</p>
        <p>The initial step entails users selecting the zones they wish to traverse. They have the flexibility to choose between one and ten zones according to their preferences. Subsequently, upon submitting their chosen zones, a new page will display detailed instructions accompanied by helpful images, guiding users through the Botanical Garden of Iasi</p>
        <p>To realize this goal, we have designed a new class called "Intersections" to encapsulate the primary intersections within the Botanical Garden. Each intersection is characterized by properties such as label, left, right, and forward. The label denotes the intersection's identification, while the direction properties indicate either a botanical garden zone or another intersection, aligning with the botanical garden's map layout.
        </p>
        <p>Adhering to the rule that users can traverse only through intersections, stops at zones occur only if selected by the user during the tour. Consequently, each intersection maintains an array of images illustrating the route from all preceding intersections leading to it.</p>
        <p>Based on this model, we have devised an algorithm, specifically a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm, which navigates through intersections to identify a viable route encompassing all user-selected zones. Along this route, pertinent images and messages (e.g., "At the next intersection, take a left.") are presented based on the directional labels guiding users through the garden.</p>

      <h2>Modeling a Taxonomy</h2>
      <p>We aim to construct a computational model of the Botanical Garden of Iasi. This entails characterizing two main components: the distinct zones within the Botanical Garden and the taxonomic classification and representation of the plant species inhabiting each respective zone. The acquisition of zone classifications and the associated plant species within each zone will be obtained directly from the official website of the Botanical Garden of Iasi. The garden comprises a total of ten delineated zones, categorized according to thematic distinctions, each encompassing a diverse array of plants.</p>
      <p>We intend to create RDF (Resource Description Framework) data for the zones as the initial step in establishing a taxonomy. Each zone will be represented by a unique URL and will possess several properties, including a label, a description, and a list of associated plants. To facilitate this representation, we will introduce a new type, "Zone," which will be defined as an RDF-schema Class. The label property will adhere to the URL specified by the RDF-schema, while we will model the description and list_of_plants properties. The description property will be domain-specific to a zone and will have a string as its range, while the list of plants property will also be domain-specific to a zone, with a list of URLs representing the plants within that zone as its range. Through this approach, we aim to comprehensively model all zones within the Botanical Garden, subsequently storing them as triples in our Apache Fuseki Database Server under a new database named "/Zones".</p>
      <p>Modeling the plants within the Botanical Garden presents a significant challenge due to the vast number of species—exceeding 100—distributed across its various zones. Our approach involves organizing the plant data into distinct folders, each corresponding to a specific zone within the garden. As the Botanical Garden's website lacks comprehensive information about individual plant species, we rely on manual search processes to compile data for each plant. For every plant identified within a zone, we create a separate file.</p>
      <p>Given the limited information available, we construct URLs for each plant using a standardized format that incorporates the respective zone and plant names, structured as follows: "localhost:5000/zone/<zone_name>/plant/<plant_name>". Despite having only partial information about the plant labels and their corresponding zones, we aim to gather additional details, such as taxonomic classifications, habitat descriptions, and potential subspecies, to enrich the dataset. This process will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the botanical diversity within the Botanical Garden of Iasi.</p>

      <h2>Use of external/knowledge resources</h2>

      <p>Our strategy involves leveraging a variety of external resources to enrich the representation of plant properties within our taxonomy. Initially, we utilize DBpedia and employ SPARQL queries to retrieve pertinent data based on the labels obtained from the Botanical Garden's website. Among the data provided by DBpedia, we prioritize extracting information regarding the abstract and subspecies properties, which are pre-defined within the DBpedia ontology, and thereby accessible via specific URLs.    </p>
      <p>Recognizing the limitations of DBpedia in providing comprehensive plant information, we transition to utilizing the Plant Ontology (PO) available at "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/search?q=plant&ontology=po". This ontology furnishes a broader array of properties, including type (Class), sub_Class_of, has_rank, and hasExactSynonym, each accompanied by pre-defined URLs within the ontology structure.</p>
      <p>To facilitate cross-referencing and integration of data sources, we introduce the "Owl:sameAs" property, associating each plant with its corresponding DBpedia and ontology pages. By amalgamating information from DBpedia and Plant Ontology, we construct a comprehensive taxonomy structure that encompasses essential details about plants and their respective zones within the Botanical Garden of Iasi.</p>
      <p>To address the lack of information regarding plant taxonomy, ecology, and habitat, we intend to parse Wikipedia pages associated with each plant using a Python API. By doing so, we aim to extract pertinent details to augment our dataset. Specifically, we will retrieve taxonomy, ecology, and habitat information from the Wikipedia pages.</p>
      <p>By incorporating this additional data, we enrich our existing dataset with a multitude of plant-related information. Subsequently, we plan to integrate these enriched data sets into our triple store, establishing a new database labeled "/Plants". This database will serve as a repository for storing and organizing the diverse array of plant information collected from various external sources, including DBpedia, Plant Ontology, and Wikipedia. Through this comprehensive approach, we aspire to create a robust and informative taxonomy structure that encapsulates essential attributes of plant species found within the Botanical Garden of Iasi.</p>
