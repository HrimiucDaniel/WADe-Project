    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Malus sylvestris, the European crab apple, is a species of the genus Malus, native to Europe. Its scientific name means "forest apple" and the truly wild tree has thorns.</ns5:abstract>
    <ns2:habitat>

The tree is widespread throughout Europe, with the exception of the extreme north and south. Additionally, it is also distributed in Anatolia and further into the
south Caucasus
.

However, it occurs in a scattered distribution pattern as single individuals or in small groups.

Due to its weak competitiveness and high light requirement, the wild apple is found mostly at sites where competition is reduced, such as the wet edge of forests, in
wood pasture
, farmland hedges or on very extreme, marginal sites.

In the British Isles it occurs throughout
Ireland
, England and Wales and with reduced frequency in Scotland.

In Scotland, it is most commonly found in woodlands and wood pastures.
