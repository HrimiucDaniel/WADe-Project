    <ns2:abstract xml:lang="en">The Scrophulariaceae are a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the figwort family. The plants are annual and perennial herbs, as well as shrubs. Flowers have bilateral (zygomorphic) or rarely radial (actinomorphic) symmetry. The Scrophulariaceae have a cosmopolitan distribution, with the majority found in temperate areas, including tropical mountains. The family name is based on the name of the included genus Scrophularia L.</ns2:abstract>

This article needs a comparison between the current and obsolete circumscriptions of the group, its current composition, and the present location of excluded taxa. None of these issues is adequately dealt with here.

In the past, it was treated as including about 275 genera and over 5,000 species, but its circumscription has been radically altered since numerous molecular
phylogenies
have shown the traditional broad circumscription to be grossly
polyphyletic
.

Many genera have recently been transferred to other families within the
Lamiales
, notably
Plantaginaceae
and
Orobanchaceae
, but also several new families.


Several families of the Lamiales have had their circumscriptions enlarged to accommodate genera transferred from the Scrophulariacae
sensu lato
.

Fischer (2004) considered the family to consist of three subfamilies –
Antirrhinoideae
,
Gratioloideae
, and
Digitalidoideae
. He further divided the Gratioloideae into five tribes –
Gratioleae
,
Angeloniaeae
,
Stemodieae
,
Limoselleae
, and
Lindernieae
. He then divided the Gratioleae, with its 16 genera (and about 182 species) into three subtribes –
Caprarinae
,
Dopatrinae
, and
Gratiolinae
. The Gratiolinae had 10 genera (about 121 species) distributed through temperate and tropical America –
Bacopa
and
Mecardonia
(formerly
Herpestis
),
Amphianthus
,
Gratiola
,
Sophronanthe
,
Benjaminia
,
Scoparia
,
Boelkea
,
Maeviella
, and
Braunblequetia
. Many of these were transferred to the family Plantaginaceae, in the tribe Gratioleae.
