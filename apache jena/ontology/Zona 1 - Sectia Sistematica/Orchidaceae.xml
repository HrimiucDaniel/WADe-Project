A majority of orchids are
perennial
epiphytes
, which grow anchored to
trees
or
shrubs
in the
tropics
and subtropics. Species such as
Angraecum
sororium
are
lithophytes
,

growing on rocks or very rocky soil. Other orchids (including the majority of
temperate
Orchidaceae) are terrestrial and can be found in habitat areas such as grasslands or forest.

Some orchids, such as
Neottia
and
Corallorhiza
, lack
chlorophyll
, so are unable to photosynthesise. Instead, these species obtain energy and nutrients by
parasitising
soil fungi through the formation of
orchid mycorrhizae
. The fungi involved include those that form
ectomycorrhizas
with trees and other woody plants, parasites such as
Armillaria
, and
saprotrophs
.

These orchids are known as
myco-heterotrophs
, but were formerly (incorrectly) described as saprophytes as it was believed they gained their nutrition by breaking down organic matter. While only a few species are achlorophyllous
holoparasites
, all orchids are myco-heterotrophic during germination and seedling growth, and even photosynthetic adult plants may continue to obtain carbon from their
mycorrhizal
fungi.


The symbiosis is typically maintained throughout the lifetime of the orchid because they depend on the fungus for nutrients, sugars and minerals.

    <ns2:taxonomy>

The
taxonomy
of this family is in constant flux, as new studies continue to clarify the relationships between species and groups of species, allowing more
taxa
at several
ranks
to be recognized. The Orchidaceae is currently placed in the
order
Asparagales
by the
APG III system
of 2009.

Five
subfamilies
are recognised. The
cladogram
below was made according to the
APG system
of 1998. It represents the view that most botanists had held up to that time. It was supported by
morphological
studies
, but never received strong support in
molecular phylogenetic
studies.
