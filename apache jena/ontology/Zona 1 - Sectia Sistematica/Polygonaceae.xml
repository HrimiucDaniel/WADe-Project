    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">The Polygonaceae are a family of flowering plants known informally as the knotweed family or smartweedâ€”buckwheat family in the United States. The name is based on the genus Polygonum, and was first used by Antoine Laurent de Jussieu in 1789 in his book, Genera Plantarum. The name may refer to the many swollen nodes the stems of some species have, being derived from Greek, poly meaning 'many' and gony meaning 'knee' or 'joint'. Alternatively, it may have a different derivation, meaning 'many seeds'. The Polygonaceae comprise about 1200 species distributed into about 48 genera. The largest genera are Eriogonum (240 species), Rumex (200 species), Coccoloba (120 species), Persicaria (100 species) and Calligonum (80 species). The family is present worldwide, but is most diverse in the North Temperate Zone. Several species are cultivated as ornamentals. A few species of Triplaris provide lumber. The fruit of the sea grape (Coccoloba uvifera) is eaten, and in Florida, jelly is made from it and sold commercially. The seeds of two species of Fagopyrum, known as buckwheat, are eaten in the form of groats or used to make a flour. The petioles of rhubarb (Rheum rhabarbarum and hybrids) are a food item. The leaves of the common sorrel (Rumex acetosa) are eaten in salads or as a leaf vegetable. Polygonaceae contain some of the most prolific weeds, including species of Persicaria, Rumex and Polygonum, such as Japanese knotweed.</ns5:abstract>
    <ns2:taxonomy>

Polygonaceae are very well-defined and have long been universally recognized. In the
APG III system
, the family is placed in the
order
Caryophyllales
.

Within the order, it lies outside of the large
clade
known as the core Caryophyllales.

It is a
sister
to the family
Plumbaginaceae
, which it does not resemble
morphologically
.

The last comprehensive revision of the family was published in 1993 by John Brandbyge as part of
The Families and Genera of Vascular Plants
.

Brandbyge followed
earlier systems
of
plant classification
in dividing Polygonaceae into two
subfamilies
,
Eriogonoideae
and
Polygonoideae
. Since 1993, the
circumscriptions
of these two subfamilies have been changed in light of
phylogenetic
studies
of
DNA sequences
.

Genera related to
Coccoloba
and
Triplaris
were moved from Polygonoideae to Eriogonoideae. The genus
Symmeria
does not belong to either of these subfamilies because it is a sister to the rest of the family.

Afrobrunnichia
might constitute a new subfamily as well.

Brandbyge wrote descriptions for 43 genera of Polygonaceae in 1993.

Since then, a few more genera have been erected, and some
segregates
of
Brunnichia
,
Eriogonum
, and
Persicaria
have been given generic
status
in major works.



Some of the genera were found not to be
monophyletic
and their limits have been revised. These include
Ruprechtia
,
Eriogonum
,
Chorizanthe
,
Persicaria
,
Aconogonon
,
Polygonum
,
Fallopia
, and
Muehlenbeckia
.
