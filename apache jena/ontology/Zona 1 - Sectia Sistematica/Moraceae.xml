    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">The Moraceae — often called the mulberry family or fig family — are a family of flowering plants comprising about 38 genera and over 1100 species. Most are widespread in tropical and subtropical regions, less so in temperate climates; however, their distribution is cosmopolitan overall. The only synapomorphy within the Moraceae is presence of laticifers and milky sap in all parenchymatous tissues, but generally useful field characters include two carpels sometimes with one reduced, compound inconspicuous flowers, and compound fruits. The family includes well-known plants such as the fig, banyan, breadfruit, jackfruit, mulberry, and Osage orange. The 'flowers' of Moraceae are often pseudanthia (reduced inflorescences).</ns5:abstract>

Formerly included within the now defunct order
Urticales
, recent molecular studies have resulted in the family's placement within the
Rosales
in a clade called the urticalean rosids that also includes
Ulmaceae
,
Celtidaceae
,
Cannabaceae
, and
Urticaceae
.
Cecropia
, which has variously been placed in the Moraceae, Urticaceae, or their own family, Cecropiaceae, is now included in the Urticaceae.

Dioecy
(having individuals with separate sexes) appears to be the primitive state in Moraceae.

Monoecy
has evolved independently at least four times within the family.
