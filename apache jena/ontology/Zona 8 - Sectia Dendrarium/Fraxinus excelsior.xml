    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Fraxinus excelsior, known as the ash, or European ash or common ash to distinguish it from other types of ash, is a flowering plant species in the olive family Oleaceae. It is native throughout mainland Europe east to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains, and Britain and Ireland, the latter determining its western boundary. The northernmost location is in the Trondheimsfjord region of Norway. The species is widely cultivated and reportedly naturalised in New Zealand and in scattered locales in the United States and Canada.</ns5:abstract>

Ash occurs on a wide range of
soil
types, but is particularly associated with basic soils on calcareous substrates. The most northerly ashwood in Britain is on limestone at Rassal,
Wester Ross
, latitude 57.4278 N.

Ash prefers moister soil types and is commonly limited by temperature and so not found at the higher colder altitudes in much of Europe, though in Iran, it may reach 2000 m asl. As a young seedling, it is shade tolerant, but older trees are light-demanding. It is an early-
succession
species and may well outcompete beech and oak, which are later-succession species.

F. excelsior
mycorrhizae are of the internal
arbuscular mycorrhizal
type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex. Unlike other
Fraxinus
species,
F. excelsior
does not form
ectomycorrhizae
.

The
Biological Records Centre
of the UK records 111 species of insects and mites using ash as a food plant, of which 29 are specific to ash. A further six are specific to ash and its
Oleaceae
relative wild privet (
Ligustrum vulgare
).

A number of
Lepidoptera
species use the species as a food source.

One example of an ash-specific feeding moth is the centre-barred sallow (
Atethmia centrago
). The larvae burrow into the buds when newly hatched and later feed on the flowers and leaves.

A common moth which causes the browning of ash leaves, as well as
garden privet
and
lilac
, is
Gracillaria syringella
. The usually gregarious larvae form an epidermal gallery (i.e. feed within the leaf) which leads to a
brown blotch
with black
frass
. Later, two successive cones are formed by folding the tip of a leaf downwards.

In Britain, 14
galls
have been recorded on ash. The
British Plant Gall Society
defines a gall as "... an abnormal growth produced by a plant under the influence of another organism".
