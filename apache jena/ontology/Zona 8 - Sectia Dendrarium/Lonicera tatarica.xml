    <ns4:abstract xml:lang="en">Lonicera tatarica is a species of honeysuckle known by the common name Tatarian honeysuckle. Native to Eurasia, the plant is one of several exotic bush honeysuckles present in North America, being considered an invasive species there.</ns4:abstract>
    <ns1:habitat>

L. tatarica
is native to
Siberia
and other parts of eastern Asia, especially China.

It is also known to grow in the Himalayas. After being introduced to North America as an
ornamental plant
in 1752,

became a widespread
introduced species
and
noxious weed
. It is known across the continent west to
Alaska
and
California
, where it easily grows in disturbed habitat.

Its preferred environment is partial sun with moist, loamy soil. It is also able to grow in full shade or sun, and in dry or sandy soils.</ns1:habitat>

The species threatens native habitats because the plants grow quickly and form thick, impenetrable mats that smother their competitors.

It most commonly invades thickets, open woodlands, roadsides and fence rows. Animals such as birds and mammals disperse the seeds, causing a rapid spread which often leads to a dense understory thicket that not only restricts native plant growth but also inhibits biodiversity. Once
L. tatarica
is introduced into an environment, it is hard to control the growth of the plant in nature because honeysuckles grow at high density. In addition to high densities,
L. tatarica
has the ability to suppress the growth of other native plants in the area, thus creating
monocultures
. Problems reported with the invasion of
L. tatarica
include depletion of soil moisture and nutrients, allelopathic chemicals functioning to chemically alter the growth of native plants, and reductions in the density of tree seedlings in the area.

The wood invokes a behavioural response in about half of domestic cats. Of cats that do not respond to
catnip
, one third respond to Tatarian honeysuckle.
