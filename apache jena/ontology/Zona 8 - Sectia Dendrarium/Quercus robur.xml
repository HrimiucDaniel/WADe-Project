It has numerous common names, including "common oak", "European oak" and "English oak". In French, it is called "chêne pédoncule."



The genome of
Q. robur
has been completely sequenced (GenOak project); a first version was published in 2016. It comprises 12 chromosome pairs (2n = 24), about 26,000 genes and 750 million
bp
.

There are numerous cultivars available, among which the following are commonly grown:
'Fastigiata', cypress oak, is a large imposing tree with a narrow columnar habit.
'Concordia', golden oak, is a small, very slow-growing tree, eventually reaching 10 m (33 ft), with bright golden-yellow leaves throughout spring and summer.  It was originally raised in Van Geert's nursery at
Ghent
in 1843.
'Pendula', weeping oak, is a small to medium-sized tree with pendulous branches, reaching up to 15 m.
'Purpurea' is another small form, growing to 10 m, with purple leaves.
'Pectinata' (syn. 'Filicifolia'), cut-leaved oak, is a cultivar where the leaf is pinnately divided into fine, forward-pointing segments.
