    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Salix alba, the white willow, is a species of willow native to Europe and western and central Asia. The name derives from the white tone to the undersides of the leaves. It is a medium-sized to large deciduous tree growing up to 10–30 m tall, with a trunk up to 1 m diameter and an irregular, often-leaning crown. The bark is grey-brown, and deeply fissured in older trees. The shoots in the typical species are grey-brown to green-brown. The leaves are paler than most other willows, due to a covering of very fine, silky white hairs, in particular on the underside; they are 5–10 cm long and 0.5–1.5 cm wide. The flowers are produced in catkins in early spring, and pollinated by insects. It is dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate trees; the male catkins are 4–5 cm long, the female catkins 3–4 cm long at pollination, lengthening as the fruit matures. When mature in midsummer, the female catkins comprise numerous small (4 mm) capsules, each containing numerous minute seeds embedded in white down, which aids wind dispersal.</ns5:abstract>

Like all willows,
Salix alba
is usually to be found in wet or poorly-drained soil at the edge of pools, lakes or rivers. Its wide-spreading roots take up moisture from a large surrounding area.

White willows are fast-growing but relatively short-lived, being susceptible to several
diseases
, including
watermark disease
caused by the
bacterium
Brenneria salicis
(named because of the characteristic 'watermark' staining in the
wood
; syn.
Erwinia salicis
) and willow
anthracnose
, caused by the fungus
Marssonina salicicola
. These diseases can be a serious problem on trees grown for timber or ornament.
