T. latifolia
is an "obligate wetland" species, meaning that it is always found in or near water.

The species generally grows in flooded areas where the water depth does not exceed
0.8 m (

ft),

but has also been reported growing in floating mats in slightly deeper water.

It grows mostly in fresh water but also occurs in slightly brackish marshes.

The species can displace other species native to salt marshes upon reduction in salinity. Under such conditions the plant may be considered aggressive since it interferes with preservation of the salt marsh habitat.

T. latifolia
shares its range with other related species, and hybridizes with
Typha angustifolia
, narrow-leaf cattail, to form
Typha × glauca
(
T. angustifolia × T. latifolia
), white cattail.

Common cattail is usually found in shallower water than narrow-leaf cattail.
