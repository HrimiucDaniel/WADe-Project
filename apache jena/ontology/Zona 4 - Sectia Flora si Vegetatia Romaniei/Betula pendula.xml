    <rdfs:label>Betula pendula</rdfs:label>
    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Betula pendula, commonly known as silver birch, warty birch, European white birch, or East Asian white birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe, it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China, and southwest Asia in the mountains of northern Turkey, the Caucasus, and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch or weeping birch and is considered invasive in some states in the United States and parts of Canada. The tree can also be found in more temperate regions of Australia. The silver birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to the white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow and brown in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seeds get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, and one of the first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps, and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes, which have been shown to have medicinal properties.</ns5:abstract>

The silver birch grows naturally from western Europe eastwards to
Kazakhstan
, the
Sakha Republic
in
Siberia
, Mongolia, and the
Xinjiang
province in China, and southwards to the mountains of the Caucasus and northern Iran, Iraq, and Turkey. It is also native to northern Morocco and has become naturalised in some other parts of the world.

In the southern parts of its range, it is mainly found in mountainous regions. Its light seeds are easily blown by the wind and it is a pioneer species, one of the first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire. It needs plenty of light and does best on dry, acid soils and is found on heathland, mountainsides, and clinging to crags.

Its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites.

It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered
invasive
in the states of
Kentucky
,
Maryland
,
Washington
, and
Wisconsin
.

It is
naturalised
and locally invasive in parts of
Canada

The silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses, and flowering plants to grow beneath, which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include
primrose
(
Primula vulgaris
),
violet
(
Viola riviniana
),
bluebell
(
Hyacinthoides non-scripta
),
wood anemone
(
Anemone nemorosa
), and
wood sorrel
(
Oxalis acetosella
). Small shrubs that grow on the forest floor include
blaeberry
(
Vaccinium myrtillus
) and
cowberry
(
Vaccinium vitis-idaea
).

Birds found in birch woodland include the
chaffinch
,
tree pipit
,
willow warbler
,
nightingale
,
robin
,
woodcock
,
redpoll
, and
green woodpecker
.

The branches of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as
witch's brooms
growing among them, caused by the fungus
Taphrina
betulina
. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus
Fomitopsis betulina
and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the
mycorrhizal
fungus
Amanita muscaria
in a
mutualistic
relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include
Leccinum scabrum
and
Cantharellus cibarius
.

In addition to mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists the growth of the tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.

The larvae of a large number of species of butterflies, moths, and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch.

In Germany, almost 500 species of insects have been found on silver and downy birch including 106 beetles and 105
lepidopterans
, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch.

Birch dieback
disease can affect planted trees, while naturally regenerated trees seem less susceptible.

This disease also affects
B. pubescens
and in 2000 was reported at many of the sites planted with birch in Scotland during the 1990s.

In the United States, the wood is attacked by the bronze birch borer (
Agrilus anxius
), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.
