    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Opuntia, commonly called prickly pear or pear cactus, is a genus of flowering plants in the cactus family Cactaceae. Prickly pears are also known as tuna (fruit), sabra, nopal (paddle, plural nopales) from the Nahuatl word nōpalli for the pads, or nostle, from the Nahuatl word nōchtli for the fruit; or paddle cactus. The genus is named for the Ancient Greek city of Opus, where, according to Theophrastus, an edible plant grew and could be propagated by rooting its leaves. The most common culinary species is the Indian fig opuntia (O. ficus-indica).</ns5:abstract>

O. ficus-indica
thrives in regions with mild winters having a prolonged dry spell followed by hot summers with occasional rain and relatively low humidity.

A mean annual rainfall of
350–500 mm (14–

in) provides good growth rates.

O. ficus-indica
proliferates in various soils ranging from sub
acid
to sub
alkaline
, with clay content not exceeding 15–20% and the soil well-drained.

The shallow root system enables the plant to grow in shallow, loose soils, such as on mountain slopes.

Opuntia
spreads into large clonal colonies, which contribute to its being considered a
noxious weed
in some places.

Animals that eat
Opuntia
include the
prickly pear island snail
and
Cyclura
rock iguanas. The fruit are relished by many arid-land animals, chiefly birds, which thus help distribute the seeds.
Opuntia
pathogens
include the sac fungus
Colletotrichum coccodes
and
Sammons'
Opuntia
virus
. The ant
Crematogaster opuntiae
and the spider
Theridion opuntia
are named because of their association with prickly pear cactus.

When
Carl Linnaeus
published
Species Plantarum
in 1753 – the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature – he placed all the species of cactus known to him in one genus,
Cactus
. In 1754, the Scottish botanist
Philip Miller
divided them into several genera, including
Opuntia
. He distinguished the genus largely on the form of its flowers and fruits.

Considerable variation of taxonomy occurs within
Opuntia
species, resulting in names being created for variants or subtypes within a species, and use of
DNA sequencing
to define and isolate various species.
