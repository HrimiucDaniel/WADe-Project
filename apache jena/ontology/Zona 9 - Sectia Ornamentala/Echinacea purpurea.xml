    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Echinacea purpurea, the eastern purple coneflower, purple coneflower, hedgehog coneflower, or echinacea, is a North American species of flowering plant in the family Asteraceae. It is native to parts of eastern North America and present to some extent in the wild in much of the eastern, southeastern and midwestern United States as well as in the Canadian Province of Ontario. It is most common in the Ozarks and in the Mississippi/Ohio Valley. Its habitats include dry open woods, prairies and barrens.</ns1:abstract>

Many pollinators are attracted to
E. purpea
. Bees that are attracted to the flowers include
bumblebees
,
sweat bees
,
honey bees
, the
sunflower leafcutter bee
, and the mining bee
Andrena helianthiformis
. Butterflies that visit include
monarchs
,

Echinacea
is derived from
Greek
, meaning 'spiny one', in reference to the spiny sea urchins 'εχίνοι' which the ripe flower heads of species of this genus resemble. The epithet
purpurea
means 'reddish-purple'.

Originally named
Rudbeckia purpurea
by Linnaeus in 1753 in Species plantarum 6, it was reclassified in 1794 by Conrad Moench, in a new genus named
Echinacea purpurea
(L.) Moench. In 1818,
Thomas Nuttall
describes a new variety that he named
Rudbeckia purpurea
var. serotina. Just two decades later, De Candolle raised him to the rank of species of the other genus
Echinacea serotina
(Nutt.) DC. (1836).

In 2002, Binns et al. discovered a misapplication of the name
Echinacea purpurea
(L.) Moench
for the taxon correctly named
Echinacea serotina
(Nutt.) DC.
in 1836. The authors proposed to retain the names not to cause confusion among gardeners and herbalists.

Other names include: Broad-leaved purple coneflower, Eastern Purple Coneflower, Hedgehog Coneflower, Echinacea.
