    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Acer pseudoplatanus, known as the sycamore in the British Isles and as the sycamore maple in the United States, is a species of flowering plant in the soapberry and lychee family Sapindaceae. It is a large deciduous, broad-leaved tree, tolerant of wind and coastal exposure. It is native to Central Europe and Western Asia, from France eastward to Ukraine, northern Turkey and the Caucasus and southward in the mountains of Italy and northern Iberia. The sycamore establishes itself easily from seed and was introduced to the British Isles by 1500. It is now naturalised there and in other parts of Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand, where it may become an invasive species. The sycamore can grow to a height of about 35 m (115 ft) and the branches form a broad, rounded crown. The bark is grey, smooth when young and later flaking in irregular patches. The leaves grow on long leafstalks and are large and palmate, with five large radiating lobes. The flowers are greenish-yellow and hang in dangling flowerheads called panicles. They produce copious amounts of pollen and nectar that are attractive to insects. The winged seeds or samaras are borne in pairs and twirl to the ground when ripe. They germinate freely in the following spring. In its native range, the sycamore is associated with a biodiverse range of invertebrates and fungi, but these are not always present in areas to which it has been introduced. It is sometimes planted in urban areas for its value as an amenity tree. It produces a hard-wearing, creamy-white close-grained timber that is used for making musical instruments, furniture, joinery, wood flooring and kitchen utensils. It also makes good firewood. The rising sap in spring has been used to extract sugar and make alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Bees collecting the nectar make honey.</ns5:abstract>

In its native range, the sycamore is a natural component of birch (
Betula
sp.), beech (
Fagus
sp.) and fir (
Abies
sp.) forests.

It readily invades disturbed habitats such as forest plantations, abandoned farmland and
brownfield land
, railway lines and roadsides verges, hedgerows, native and semi-natural woodland. In New Zealand, it invades the high country tussock grassland.  As an introduced, invasive species, it may degrade the laurel forest in Madeira and Portugal and is a potential threat to the rare
endemic
Madeiran orchid,
Dactylorhiza foliosa
.

It is tolerant of a wide range of soil types and pH, except heavy clay, and is at its best on nutrient-rich, slightly calcareous soils. The roots of the sycamore form highly specific beneficial
mycorrhizal
associations with the fungus
Glomus hoi
, which promotes
phosphorus uptake
from the soil.

Sycamore mycorrhizas are of the internal
arbuscular mycorrhizal
type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex.

The larvae of a number of species of
moth
use the leaves as a food source. These include the
sycamore moth
(
Acronicta aceris
), the maple prominent (
Ptilodon cucullina
) and the plumed prominent (
Ptilophora plumigera
).

The
horse-chestnut leaf miner
(
Cameraria ohridella
) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second
instar
.

The leaves attract aphids, and also the
ladybirds
and
hoverflies
that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as
voles
and birds.

As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species,

but it does have a larger range of
leafhoppers
than does the native field maple.

The tree may also be attacked by the
horse chestnut scale insect
(
Pulvinaria regalis
), which sucks sap from the trunk and branches, but does not cause serious damage to the tree.

Sometimes squirrels will strip the bark off branches, girdling the stem; as a result whole branches may die, leaving brown, wilted leaves.

The sycamore gall mite
Eriophyes
macrorhynchus

produces small red
galls
, similar to those of the nail gall mite
Eriophyes tiliae
, on leaves of sycamore and field maple,
Acer campestris
from April onwards.

Another mite,
Aceria pseudoplatani
causes a 'sycamore felt gall' on the underside of leaves of both sycamore and Norway maple (
Acer platanoides
).

The sycamore aphid
Drepanosiphum platanoidis
sucks
sap
from buds and foliage, producing large quantities of sticky
honeydew
that contaminate foliage, cars and garden furniture beneath.

The sycamore is susceptible to sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus
Cryptostroma corticale
. This causes wilting of the crown and the death of branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the
heartwood
without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers.

The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper's disease, a
hypersensitivity pneumonitis
.


Less serious is the fungus
Rhytisma acerinum
which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected.

Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus
Cristulariella depraedans
, results in pale blotches on leaves which later dry up and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.

Fungal species
Coniothyrium ferrarisianum
has also been isolated from leaves of
Acer pseudoplatanus
in Italy in 1958.
