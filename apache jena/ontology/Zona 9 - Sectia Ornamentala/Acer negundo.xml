    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Acer negundo, the box elder, boxelder maple, Manitoba maple or ash-leaved maple, is a species of maple native to North America. It is a fast-growing, short-lived tree with opposite, compound leaves. It is sometimes considered a weedy or invasive species, and has been introduced to and naturalized throughout much of the world, including in South America, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, much of Europe, and parts of Asia.</ns5:abstract>

Although native to
North America
, it is considered a weedy species in some areas, such as in parts of the
Northeastern United States
, and has increased greatly in these areas.

In 1928, Joseph Illick, chief forester for the state of
Pennsylvania
, wrote in
Pennsylvania Trees

that box elder was "rare and localized" in the state. After
World War II
, box elder's rapid growth made it a popular landscaping tree in suburban housing developments despite its poor form, vulnerability to storm damage, and tendency to attract large numbers of
box elder bugs
. Intentional cultivation has thus made the tree far more abundant than it once was.

It can quickly
colonize
both cultivated and uncultivated areas and the range is therefore expanding both in North America and elsewhere. In Europe where it was introduced in 1688 as a park tree it is able to spread quickly and is considered an invasive species in parts of Central Europe, including

This species prefers bright sunlight. It often grows on flood plains and other disturbed areas with ample water supply, such as
riparian
habitats.

Human influence has greatly favored this species; it grows around houses and in hedges, as well as on disturbed ground and vacant lots.

The
boxelder bug
(
Boisea trivittata
) lays its
eggs
on all maples, but prefers this species, clustering the eggs in bark crevices.

The rosy maple moth (
Dryocampa rubicunda
) also lays its eggs on the leaves of maple trees, including
Acer negundo
. The larvae feed on the leaves, and in very dense populations can cause defoliation.

Small
galls
are formed on the leaves by a bladder mite,
Aceria negundi
. A gall midge,
Contarinia negundinis
joins and enlarges the galls of
Aceria negundi
. The midge sometimes creates a separate, tubular gall on the midrib or veins of the undersides of the leaves.

The cottony maple leaf scale,
Pulvinaria acericola
, occurs on the foliage of
Acer negundo
.

A leaf spot fungus,
Septoria negundinis
creates black-ringed lesions on the leaves.

A few botanists treat boxelder maple in its own distinct genus (
Negundo aceroides
) but this is not widely accepted.
