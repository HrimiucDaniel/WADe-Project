    <ns5:abstract xml:lang="en">Urtica dioica, often known as common nettle, burn nettle, stinging nettle (although not all plants of this species sting) or nettle leaf, or just a nettle or stinger, is a herbaceous perennial flowering plant in the family Urticaceae. Originally native to Europe, much of temperate Asia and western North Africa, it is now found worldwide, including New Zealand and North America. The species is divided into six subspecies, five of which have many hollow stinging hairs called trichomes on the leaves and stems, which act like hypodermic needles, injecting histamine and other chemicals that produce a stinging sensation upon contact ("contact urticaria", a form of contact dermatitis). The plant has a long history of use as a source for traditional medicine, food, tea, and textile raw material in ancient (such as Saxon) and modern societies.</ns5:abstract>

A stinging nettle growing in a field
U. dioica
is considered to be native to Europe, much of temperate
Asia
and western
North Africa
.

It is abundant in
northern Europe
and much of Asia, usually found in the countryside.

It is less widespread in southern Europe and north Africa, where it is restricted by its need for moist soil, but is still common. It has been introduced to many other parts of the world. In North America, it is widely distributed in
Canada
and the
United States
, where it is found in every province and state except for
Hawaii
, and also can be found in northernmost
Mexico
. It grows in abundance in the
Pacific Northwest
, especially in places where annual rainfall is high. The European subspecies has been introduced into Australia, North America and
South America
.

In Europe, nettles have a strong association with human habitation and buildings. The presence of nettles may indicate the site of a long-abandoned building, and can also indicate
soil fertility
.

Human and animal waste may be responsible for elevated levels of
phosphate

and
nitrogen
in the soil, providing an ideal environment for nettles.

Nettles are the
larval
food plant for several species of
butterflies
, such as the
peacock butterfly
,

comma (
Polygonia c-album
), and the
small tortoiseshell
. It is also eaten by the larvae of some
moths

angle shades

are sometimes eaten by the larva of the

Stinging nettle is particularly found as an understory plant in wetter environments, but it is also found in meadows. Although nutritious, it is not widely eaten by either wildlife or livestock, presumably because of the sting. It spreads by abundant seeds and also by rhizomes, and is often able to survive and re-establish quickly after fire.

Credit for the scientific naming of
Urtica dioica
is given to
Carl Linnaeus
who published it in
Species Plantarum
in 1753.

The
taxonomy
of
Urtica
species is confused, and sources are likely to use a variety of systematic names for these plants. Until 2014 there was broad consensus that the nettles native to the Americas, now classified as
Urtica gracilis
, were
subspecies
of
Urtica dioica
. However, in that year the paper "Weeding the Nettles II" was published in the journal
Phytotaxa
demonstrating the genetic distinctness of new world nettles.

As of 2023
Plants of the World Online
(POWO) recognizes
U. gracilis
as a distinct species while the USDA
Natural Resources Conservation Service
PLANTS database (PLANTS) continues to list it as
U. dioica
subsp.
gracilis
, as does the Flora of North America (FNA).
