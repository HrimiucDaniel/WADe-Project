    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Taxus baccata is a species of evergreen tree in the family Taxaceae, native to western, central and southern Europe (including Britain and Ireland), northwest Africa, northern Iran, and southwest Asia. It is the tree originally known as yew, though with other related trees becoming known, it may now be known as common yew, English yew, or European yew. It is primarily grown as an ornamental. Most parts of the plant are poisonous, with toxins that can be absorbed through inhalation and through the skin; consumption of even a small amount of the foliage can result in death.</ns1:abstract>

T. baccata
is native to all countries of Europe (except Iceland), the Caucasus, and beyond from Turkey eastwards to northern Iran. Its range extends south to Morocco and Algeria in North Africa.

A few populations are also present in the archipelagos of the Azores

and Madeira.

The limit of its northern
Scandinavian
distribution is its sensitivity to frost, with
global warming
predicted to allow its spread inland.

It has been introduced elsewhere, including the United States.

Aside from its natural habitat, it is also common to find English Yew in gardens because it is very tolerate to pruning and cemeteries, as it symbolizes death.

'
s richest central European populations are in
Swiss
yew-beech woodlands, on cool, steep
marl
slopes up to 1,400 metres (4,600Â ft) in elevation in the
Jura Mountains
and
Alpine foothills
. In
England
it grows best in steep slopes of the
chalk downs
, forming extensive stands invading the grassland outside the beech woods. In more
continental climates
of Europe it fares better in
mixed forests
, of both
coniferous
and mixed broadleaf-conifer composition. Under its evergreen shade, no other plants can grow.

T. baccata
prefers steep rocky
calcareous
slopes. It rarely develops beyond saplings on acid soil when under a forest canopy, but is tolerant of soil pH when planted by humans, such as their traditional placement in
churchyards
and
cemeteries
, where some of the largest and oldest trees in northwestern Europe are found.

It grows well in well-drained soils,

tolerating nearly any soil type, typically
humus
and
base-rich
soils, but also on
rendzina
and
sand
soils given adequate moisture. They can survive temporary flooding and moderate droughts. Roots can penetrate extremely compressed soils, such as on rocky terrain and vertical cliff faces.

T. baccata
normally appears individually or in small groups within the
understory
, but also forms stands throughout its range,

such as in sheltered calcareous sites.

T. baccata
is extremely shade-tolerant, with the widest temperature range for
photosynthesis
among European trees, able to photosynthesize in winter after deciduous trees have shed their leaves.

It can grow under partial canopies of
beech
and other
deciduous
broad-leafed trees, though it only grows into large trees without such shade.

In centuries past
T. baccata
was exterminated from many woodlands as a poisonous hazard to the cattle and horses that often grazed in the woods

. Rabbits and deer however have a level of immunity to the poisonous alkaloids, and the seeds are dispersed by birds,

with
thrushes
greatly enjoying the fruit.

It also regenerates readily from stumps and roots, even when ancient and hollow.
