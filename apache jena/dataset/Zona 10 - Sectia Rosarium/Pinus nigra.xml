    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Pinus nigra, the Austrian pine or black pine, is a moderately variable species of pine, occurring across Southern Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the eastern Mediterranean, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey, Corsica and Cyprus, as well as Crimea and in the high mountains of Northwest Africa.</ns1:abstract>
    <ns1:habitat>

Pinus nigra
is a tree of the
Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub
biome
. 
The majority of the range is in Turkey. It is found in the higher elevations of the
South Apennine mixed montane forests
ecoregion
in southern Italy and the
Tyrrhenian-Adriatic sclerophyllous and mixed forests
ecoregion in Sicily. There are remnant populations in the
Mediterranean conifer and mixed forests
ecoregion, and in the higher
Atlas Mountains
in Morocco and Algeria.

The species is divided into two subspecies, each further subdivided into three varieties.


Some authorities (e.g.
Flora Europaea
) treat several of the varieties at subspecific rank, but this reflects tradition rather than sound taxonomy, as the distinctions between the taxa are small.
