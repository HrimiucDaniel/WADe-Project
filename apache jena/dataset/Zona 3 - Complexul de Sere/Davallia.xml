    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Davallia (deersfoot fern, hare's foot fern, shinobu fern, rabbit foot fern, ball fern) is a genus of about 40 species of fern. In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), it is the only genus in the family Davalliaceae, which is placed in the suborder Polypodiineae, order Polypodiales. Alternatively, the family may be placed in a very broadly defined family Polypodiaceae sensu lato as the subfamily Davallioideae. The family is sister to the largest family of ferns, Polypodiaceae, and shares some morphological characters with it. Species are epiphytic ferns, with fronds arising from long aerial rhizomes which grow on and over thick bark on trees or on rock crevices.</ns1:abstract>

to
tropical

regions of the
Pacific

Australia
,
Asia
, and
Africa
.

Plants are usually

Gymnogrammitis
and
Leucostegia
were once included in Davalliaceae, but these are now known to belong elsewhere.
Gymnogrammitis
is in a
clade
with
Selliguea
and others in the family Polypodiaceae.

Leucostegia
is in the family
Hypodematiaceae
,

which consists of
Hypodematium
and
Leucostegia
,

and possibly
Didymochlaena
as well.

In 2008, a
molecular phylogenetic
study
of Davalliaceae showed that none of the
polyspecific
genera recognized at that time were
monophyletic
.

In that same year, a revision of the family divided it into five genera.

One of these,
Araiostegiella
, was newly described. The genus
Davallia
was divided into two
sections
,
named
Davallia
and
Trogostolon
. Based on
molecular phylogenetic
studies, the
Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group
classification of 2016 (PPG I) accepts only one genus in the family,
Davallia
, sinking the other genera into synonymy.

The study on which the PPG I
circumscription
is based divides the genus into seven sections.
