    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Geraniaceae is a family of flowering plants placed in the order Geraniales. The family name is derived from the genus Geranium. The family includes both the genus Geranium (the cranesbills, or true geraniums) and the garden plants called geraniums, which modern botany classifies as genus Pelargonium, along with other related genera. The family comprises 830 species in five to seven genera. The largest genera are Geranium (430 species), Pelargonium (280 species) and Erodium (80 species).</ns1:abstract>

    <ns1:habitat>

Most species are found in temperate or warm temperate regions, though some are tropical.
Pelargonium
has its centre for diversity in the
Cape
region in
South Africa
, where there is a striking vegetative and floral variation.

Geraniaceae and
Francoaceae
are the two families included in the order
Geraniales
under the
Angiosperm Phylogeny Group
(APG) classification (APG IV).

There has been some uncertainty in the number of genera to be included.
Stevens
gives seven genera listed here,

while Christenhusz and Byng

state five genera.

Hypseocharis
, with between one and three species, which comes from the south-west
Andean
region of
South America
, is considered the
sister
to the rest of the family. Some authors separate
Hyspeocharis
as a monogeneric family
Hypseocharitaceae
,

while older sources placed it in the
Oxalidaceae
. The genus
Rhynchotheca
has also been separated into the
Vivianiaceae
.

The Geraniaceae have a number of genetic features unique amongst angiosperms, including highly rearranged
plastid
genomes
differing in
gene
content, order and expansion of the
inverted repeat
.
