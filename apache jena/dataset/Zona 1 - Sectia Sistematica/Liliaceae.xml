    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">The lily family, Liliaceae, consists of about 15 genera and 610 species of flowering plants within the order Liliales. They are monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, often bulbous geophytes. Plants in this family have evolved with a fair amount of morphological diversity despite genetic similarity. Common characteristics include large flowers with parts arranged in threes: with six colored or patterned petaloid tepals (undifferentiated petals and sepals) arranged in two whorls, six stamens and a superior ovary. The leaves are linear in shape, with their veins usually arranged parallel to the edges, single and arranged alternating on the stem, or in a rosette at the base. Most species are grown from bulbs, although some have rhizomes. First described in 1789, the lily family became a paraphyletic "catch-all" (wastebasket) group of lilioid monocots that did not fit into other families and included a great number of genera now included in other families and in some cases in other orders. Consequently, many sources and descriptions labelled "Liliaceae" deal with the broader sense of the family. The family evolved approximately 68 million years ago during the Late Cretaceous to Early Paleogene epochs. Liliaceae are widely distributed, mainly in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere and the flowers are insect pollinated. Many Liliaceae are important ornamental plants, widely grown for their attractive flowers and involved in a major floriculture of cut flowers and dry bulbs. Some species are poisonous if eaten and can have adverse health effects in humans and household pets. A number of Liliaceae genera are popular cultivated plants in private and public spaces. Lilies and tulips in particular have had considerable symbolic and decorative value, and appear frequently in paintings and the decorative arts. They are also an economically important product. Most of their genera, Lilium in particular, face considerable herbivory pressure from deer in some areas, both wild and domestic.</ns1:abstract>

The Liliaceae are widely distributed, but mainly in the
temperate regions
of the
Northern Hemisphere
. The
centre of diversity
is from
southwest Asia
to
China
. Their distribution is diverse, mainly in
plains
,
steppes
, and
alpine meadows
, but also in
deciduous forests
,
Mediterranean scrub
and
arctic tundra
.


Tulipa
and
Gagea
provide examples of ornamental geophyte biomorphological types representing continental thermoperiodic zones (
Irano-Turanian region
), characterised by cessation of underground growth at high temperatures in early summer and requiring low winter temperatures for spring flowering.

While some genera are shade-dwelling, such as the Medeoleae, and  Streptopoideae,
Tricyrtis
, and
Cardiocrinum
, others prefer a more open habitat.

    <ns1:ecology>

The Liliaceae are ecologically diverse.

Species of Liliaceae bloom at various times from spring to late summer. The colorful flowers produce large amounts of
nectar
and
pollen
that attract
insects
which
pollinate
them (entomophily), particularly
bees
and
wasps
(hymenopterophily),
butterflies
(psychophily) and
moths
(phalaenophily).

The
seeds
are
dispersed
by wind and water. Some species (e.g.
Scoliopus
,
Erythronium and Gagea
) have seeds with an
aril
structure that are dispersed by
ants
(
myrmecochory
).

The proliferation of deer populations in many areas, due to human factors such as the elimination of their animal predators and introduction to alien environments, is placing considerable herbivory pressure on many of the family's species.

Fences as high as 8 feet may be required to prevent them from consuming the plants, an impractical solution for most wild areas.

Those of the genus
Lilium
are particularly palatable, while species in
Fritillaria
are repellant.

Taxonomy of Liliaceae
Taxonomy of Liliaceae
The taxonomy of the Liliaceae has a very complex history. The family was first described in the eighteenth century, and over time many other genera were added until it became one of the largest of the monocotyledon families, and also extremely diverse. Modern taxonomic systems, such as the
APG
which is based on
phylogenetic
principles using
molecular biology
, have redistributed many of these genera resulting in the relatively small family that is currently recognised. Consequently, there are many different accounts of the Liliaceae in the literature and older uses of the term occur commonly. To distinguish between them, the
Latin
terms
sensu lato
and
sensu stricto
are frequently used (together with their abbreviations,
s.l.
and
s.s.
) to denote the broader or stricter sense of the circumscription respectively, e.g. Liliaceae
