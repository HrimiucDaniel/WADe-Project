    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Sorbus torminalis, with common names wild service tree, chequers, and checker tree, is a species of tree in the mountain ash or rowan genus (Sorbus) of the rose family (Rosaceae), that is native to Europe, parts of northern Africa and western Asia.</ns1:abstract>
    <ns1:habitat>

It is found from Great Britain (
England
and
Wales
) east to Denmark and Poland, south to northwest Africa, and southeast to southwest Asia from Asia Minor to the
Caucasus
and
Alborz
mountains.

The wild service tree favours deep fertile soils, but can tolerate a wide range of soil conditions, from chalky, superficial, dry soils to temporarily waterlogged soils, often found alongside the
true service tree
. It can adapt to a variety of climatic conditions, but occurs most often in lowlands. Wild service tree is a light-demanding species, often out-competed by other
hardwood
species.

It is relatively rare and in
Britain
is now usually confined to pockets of
ancient woodland
, although it can also be found growing in
hedgerows
. It can often be found associated with
oak
and
ash
woods, preferring
clay
and
lime
based soils. In Britain, summer temperatures are often too low for the seeds to ripen, so its principal method of
propagation
is by
suckers
.

The fruits are eaten by many birds and a few mammals, making the tree ecologically important.

The genus
Torminalis
was formerly included within the genus
Sorbus
, as the
section
Torminaria
, but the simple-leafed species traditionally classified in
Sorbus
are now considered to form a separate
monophyletic group
.

Torminalis glaberrima
is a sexually reproducing
diploid
species that forms diploid and polyploid hybrids with members of the genus
Aria
(whitebeams).

A number of often very localised stable
apomictic
polyploid species of ultimately
hybrid
origin between
Sorbus torminalis
and various species in the genus
Aria
occur in Europe, including
Sorbus latifolia
(service tree of Fontainebleau), and
S. bristoliensis
(Bristol whitebeam).
