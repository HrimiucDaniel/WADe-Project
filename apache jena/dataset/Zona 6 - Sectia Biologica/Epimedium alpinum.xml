    <ns1:abstract xml:lang="en">Epimedium alpinum, the alpine barrenwort, is a species of flowering plant in the genus Epimedium, native to the mountains of Italy, Austria, the former Yugoslavia, and Albania, and introduced into central Europe. A dwarf perennial suitable for rock gardens, it was jocularly said by John Lindley to be "known only in the gardens of botanists". Its hybrid with E. grandiflorum, Epimedium Ã— rubrum, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.</ns1:abstract>
