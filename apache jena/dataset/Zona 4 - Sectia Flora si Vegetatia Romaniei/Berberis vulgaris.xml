The berries are an important food for many small birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings.
B. vulgaris
is the
alternate host
species of the wheat stem rust fungus (
Puccinia graminis
f. sp.
tritici
), a grass-infecting
rust fungus
that is a serious fungal disease of
wheat
and related grains. For this reason, cultivation of
