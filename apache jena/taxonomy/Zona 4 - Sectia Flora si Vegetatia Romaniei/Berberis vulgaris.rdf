    <ns3:ecology>The berries are an important food for many small birds, which disperse the seeds in their droppings.
B. vulgaris
is the
alternate host
species of the wheat stem rust fungus (
Puccinia graminis
f. sp.
tritici
), a grass-infecting
rust fungus
that is a serious fungal disease of
wheat
and related grains. For this reason, cultivation of
B. vulgaris
is prohibited in Canada

and some areas of the US (
Connecticut
,
Massachusetts
,
Michigan
, and
New Hampshire
).
