        <h2>Abstract - The requirments of the project</h2>

        <p>Develop a service-oriented system offering features regarding botanical gardens' cartography, including the digital ways to explore and display educational information about species of plants. Additionally, the application will be able to manage different dataflows/workflows concerning guided tours, plant/art exhibitions (e.g., the annual Chrysanthemums autumnal exhibition), taxonomic-oriented studies (i.e. learning about plant classification), specific activities (plant conservation, soil preparation, seeding procedures, pollution prevention, etc.) and others. For each item (thing), the user could specify useful information like comments, images, relations with other near-by objects – for example, "Rosa bunda" variety of roses is placed in the centre of the rosarium section of the Botanical Gardens of Iasi. Available knowledge will be accessed via a SPARQL endpoint, in conjunction to other sources of interest such as DBpedia and/or Wikidata. Bonus: adopting (multilingual) conversational user interactions.</p>
        <p>The main purpose of the web application is to provide an integrated environment where users can find out information about the areas, the plants of a botanical garden, can make reservations for the exhibitions organized by the botanical garden and can also contribute to the community with their own comments and images related to different plants.</p>

        <h2>Front End</h2>

        <p>The user interface of the application ought to demonstrate a high degree of navigational accessibility while incorporating established best practices within the realm of user experience. We plan on having the diverse accesability features, such as the provision of text alternatives for images, utilization of semantic HTML tags, implementation of high-contrast color schemes on the site, maintenance of a consistent layout, and adoption of responsive design. These features are undertaken with the objective of preserving clarity and simplicity in our web pages, thereby facilitating ease of information retrieval for a broad spectrum of users.</p>
        <p>We plan to start by sketching the user interface by using Figma, a collaborative design and prototyping tool. Recognized for its capacity to facilitate real-time collaboration, Figma enables teams to collectively develop, share, and iterate upon digital designs. Widely embraced within the domains of user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, this approach is anticipated to instill a well-defined architectural framework for the user interface. The adoption of Figma is expected to mitigate potential ambiguities and unanticipated elements, ensuring a coherent and planned design trajectory. Furthermore, our strategic initiative includes the incorporation of multilingual conversational user interactions, aiming to broaden the spectrum of potential users for our application. This approach is designed to enhance inclusivity by accommodating users across diverse linguistic backgrounds, thereby fostering a more expansive and accessible user base.</p>
        <p>The procedural phase of implementing the user interface is poised to leverage React JS in conjunction with Bootstrap. React.js, commonly referred to as React, constitutes a JavaScript library specifically designed for constructing user interfaces. Originating from Facebook and actively maintained, React has gained widespread adoption for the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications. Its inherent component-based architecture affords developers the capability to construct encapsulated and reusable UI components. Bootstrap, a prominent front-end framework, will complement React in this implementation endeavor. Bootstrap streamlines the complexities associated with designing and developing responsive, aesthetically pleasing, and uniform user interfaces. The synergistic integration of React and Bootstrap is anticipated to yield a formidable alliance in crafting a robust and visually appealing user interface. This combination capitalizes on React's proficiency in generating dynamic user interfaces and Bootstrap's efficacy in rapid prototyping and maintaining stylistic consistency. The outcome is expected to manifest as a well-structured, responsive, and visually captivating user interface, underscored by an efficient development workflow. </p>

      <h2>Linked Data</h2>

      <p>Our application conforms Linked Data principles involves highlighting the key aspects of Linked Data, as outlined by Tim Berners-Lee in his Linked Data principles document.</p>
      <p>The representation of plant data within our system will adhere to the Resource Description Framework (RDF) paradigm. RDF vocabularies will be employed to establish interconnections among data entities and facilitate linking to external resources through the utilization of HTTP Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). To enhance accessibility for both human and machine consumption, the data will be serialized in multiple RDF formats, ranging from Turtle to RDF/XML. The serialization process will be executed using the rdflib library within the Node.js environment, aligning with best practices in semantic web technologies. This approach ensures that the plant data is not only interpretable by human users but also accessible and comprehensible to machine-based processes, fostering interoperability and facilitating seamless integration with the broader Linked Data ecosystem.</p>
     <p>As a secondary infrastructure component, we will establish a SPARQL endpoint utilizing Communica, a framework designed for querying Linked Data on the Web. This framework incorporates a SPARQL query engine, tailored for decentralized querying over RDF (Resource Description Framework) data sources. By implementing this SPARQL endpoint, our system will facilitate the exploration and utilization of semantic data on the web. This infrastructure will empower users to execute SPARQL queries, enabling them to retrieve and analyze data distributed across decentralized RDF sources. The adoption of Communica aligns with our commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technologies that enhance the accessibility and query capabilities of our linked data resources, contributing to a more dynamic and interconnected web experience.</p>
